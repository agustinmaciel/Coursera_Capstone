# Coursera_Capstone - Final Coursera Project

In this project we tried to find an optimal location for a restaurant in Montevideo, Uruguay.
- We analyzed the different neighborhoods to identify the median income and total population in order to create a ranking based on these metrics. 
- Then we tried to detect which neighborhood has the least number of food venues.
- Lastly we selected a location inside the neighborhood that is not already too crowded with restaurants.
